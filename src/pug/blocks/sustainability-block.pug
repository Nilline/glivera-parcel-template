					p Weâ€™re driven is to create sustainable, housing solutions, designed for harmonious living with the environment
					p Our team of designers, engineers, and crafts people is driven to create positive change in the building industry through intelligent design, manufacturing & material choices. We believe a small footprint can still mean highly functional and high-quality living.
					p In addition to significant material waste reduction during the production process and the energy efficiencies that are standard with each of our homes, we're helping to re-forest our planet for future generations, with every Hapi Home we sell we plant 10 trees. We have joined the One Tree Planted ecosystem to do this.
					p We approach sustainability by combining advanced manufacturing techniques with principles of the circular economy to minimise our materials and carbon footprint.
